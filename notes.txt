need of logistic regression:


time spent on social media,whether clicked on add or not
independent variable-->useractivetime
ex:  useractivetime    clickedonADD 
       2:00                 0 
       3:00                 1
       5:55                 0


linear regression plot it
the line we get ..is not helpful for predicting the dependent variable using the
independent varibale.

categorical data
ex: pass/fail,true/false,positive/negative,0/1

classification of logistic regression

sigmoid function  Y=1/1+e^(-x)
x=independent variable
e=eulers constant=2.718
Y=output

Sigmoid function is trying to convert the independent variable into a 
expression of probablity,that ranges between 0 and 1 with respect to the dependentvariable.
